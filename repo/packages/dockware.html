	 <p><p>BETA-236<br />        
	 Actually fixed custom layout numbers this time<br /><br />
	 BETA-234<br />
	 Fixed issue with icons dissappearing on certain rows etc. Fixed rotation crash. Fixed crash with trying to edit anything with folders.<br /><br />
         BETA-177<br />        
	 Fixed weird issue where (rarely) moving an icon from page to the next would move them slightly<br /><br />
         BETA-169<br />
         Came to realization it is completely unnecessary to be able to edit you page layout in the settings app. Also decided the "app drawer" was not necessary. Fixed issues with the page views not deleting if no icons were on them. I think this is pretty stable right now. Please continue to send problems you find. I appreciate the feedback all of you have provided for this beta. I also added a bunch of logs so now I can hopefully get a better understanding for whats happening with the poeple whos icons dissappear.<br /><br />
